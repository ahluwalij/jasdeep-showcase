# My Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This portfolio is built using Next.js, React, Jest, Tailwind CSS, and Three.js. I've put in the effort to create an interactive and functional portfolio that I hope to keep on expanding on in the future!

## Technologies Used

- [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) - A powerful React framework that provides server-rendering and a highly optimized build system.
- [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) - A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A low-level CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development.
- [**Three.js**](https://threejs.org/) - A 3D library that enables the creation of complex 3D graphics and animations in the browser.
- [**Jest.js**](https://jestjs.io/) - An open-source Javascript testing framework developed by Facebook primarily focusing on simplicity and support for large web applications.

## Key Features

- **Performance Optimizations**: Server-side rendering (Next.js) and automatic code splitting, resulting in faster load times and improved overall performance.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Using Jest, I am able to test all of the navigations and components that need to be loaded, so I can catch any error before it becomes a real issue in production.
- **3D Backgrounds and Interactivity**: Using Three.js, my portfolio showcases 3D backgrounds and direct canvas interaction.
- **Theme Switcher**: Integrated with `next-themes`, to support light and dark mode with live updates on the Three.js canvas. Defaults to the user's operating system theme.
- **Extensive Linting & Formatting**: With ESLint, Prettier, and Husky.
