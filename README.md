# My Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This modern, interactive showcase is built using the latest and greatest web technologies, including Next.js, React, Jest, Tailwind CSS, and Three.js. I've put in the effort to create an interactive and functional portfolio that I hope to keep on expanding on in the future!

## Technologies Used

- [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) - A powerful React framework that provides server-rendering and a highly optimized build system.
- [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) - A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A highly customizable and low-level CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development.
- [**Three.js**](https://threejs.org/) - A powerful 3D library that enables the creation of complex 3D graphics, animations, and interactions for the web.
- [**Three.js**](https://jestjs.io/) - An open-source Javascript testing framework developed by Facebook primarily focusing on simplicity and support for large web applications. Many large companies—including Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and Airbnb—use Jest for React testing.

## Key Features

- **Performance Optimizations**: Thanks to Next.js, the portfolio benefits from server-side rendering and automatic code splitting, resulting in faster load times and improved overall performance.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Using Jest, I am able to test all of the navigations and components that need to be loaded, so I can catch any error before it becomes a real issue in production.
- **3D Backgrounds and Interactivity**: Leveraging the power of Three.js, my portfolio showcases 3D backgrounds and interactive elements that create a memorable user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS, the portfolio is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Theme Switcher**: Integrated with `next-themes`, my portfolio features a theme switcher that allows users to toggle between light and dark modes, accommodating their preferences.
- **Extensive Linting & Formatting**: To maintain code quality and consistency, I've set up a strict linting and formatting pipeline using ESLint, Prettier, and Husky.

## Conclusion

I'm incredibly proud of the work I've put into creating this modern, interactive, and visually appealing personal portfolio. I've meticulously selected the technologies and features to ensure an outstanding showcase of my skills and expertise.
